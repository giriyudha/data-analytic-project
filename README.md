# Data Analytic Project Portofolio

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repo contains my data analytic portofolios. I started learning Python and Data Analytics/Data Science in September 2020 through courses from Udemy and Kaggle. The projects inside this portofolio are either the courses exercise, Kaggle Competition, or my own data insight.

Each folder in this repo contains a Jupyter Notebook file, and the necessary dataset. To view the project, you can either clone it to your own repo, or download it.

I would really appriciate any constructing comment or criticism, even the one with harsh words, so please feel free to share your thoughts!
